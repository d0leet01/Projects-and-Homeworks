I have included a few projects and homework sets which I found interesting. During a consulting course at Texas A&M in Fall 2021, I chose to analyze Game Stop's stock as a time series with ARMA-GARCH.
This is the paper I presented to the class which accompanied a fifteen minute presentation over ZOOM. The Bayesian Analysis homework takes a look at linear regression in the Bayesian context - 
complete with posterior predictive distributions. On the math side, the abstract algebra project sought to explain algebraic groups to "non-math' people
and my real analysis project showcases a very interesting series! Other than these specific exampled, all other work comes from my graduate statistics education. I hope you enjoy!
